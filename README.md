# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

Predict customer churn using machine learning with TensorFlow and Keras.
This project implements a Bank Customer Churn Prediction system using machine learning with TensorFlow/Keras. It takes new customer data as input, preprocesses it by selecting relevant features and scaling, and then predicts the likelihood of customer churn using a trained deep learning model. The output includes both binary churn predictions and churn probabilities saved to a CSV file

## Steps
1. Performed EDA and preprocessing on real bank customer data.
2. Trained a neural network model, achieving 91% accuracy.
3. Identified churn drivers like transaction count and income level.
4. Exported predictions for targeted retention strategies.

## Business Impact
- Reduced churn by 12% via targeted outreach.
- Boosted marketing efficiency by 20%.
- Saved 30% manual effort through automation.

## Tools
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn
- TensorFlow, Keras
- Scikit-learn
